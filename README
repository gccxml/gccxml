GCC-XML - This program dumps an XML description of C++ source code
using an extension on the GCC C++ compiler.

This README is intended as supplement to the documentation on the
GCC-XML homepage at http://www.gccxml.org.  More extensive
instructions may be found there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build/Install:

The standard way to build the GCC-XML front-end is to use CMake (see
links at bottom to get it).  CMake will generate an appropriate build
system for your platform and compiler.  There are separate
instructions for UNIX and Windows users.

UNIX & Cygwin:
These instructions assume that the front-end will be built
out-of-source (recommended), but an in-source build should also work.

$ mkdir gccxml-build
$ cd gccxml-build
$ cmake ../gccxml -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/installation/path
$ make
$ make install

  (The "-D..." option can be left off if you want
   to use "/usr/local" as the installation prefix.)

This will install executables called "gccxml" and "gccxml_cc1plus" in
PREFIX/bin.  Support library files will also be placed in
PREFIX/share/gccxml-(version).

Windows:
Run the CMakeSetup GUI to generate the build system for your compiler.
Load the resulting project file and build it.  You should be able to
run the executable directly from the build directory.  It will be
located in gccxml-build/bin, gccxml-build/bin/Debug, or
gccxml-build/bin/Release depending on the build system chosen.

Solaris:
Sun's CC 5.8 is supported. You need modified headers to use gccxml with CC 5.8.
You need to follow the instructions in GCC_XML/Support/Sun/README.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Running:

Once GCC-XML has been properly configured, it can be run from the
command line like this:

  gccxml input.cxx -fxml=output.xml

Use "gccxml --help" for a full list of options and configuration help.
